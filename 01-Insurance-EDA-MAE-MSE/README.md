# Insurance-EDA, MAE, MSE

## Data collection
I began by importing all of the necessary libraries, such as Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, etc. Using the code provided below, I imported and read the data after that: insurance.csv data= pd.read csv

## Learing and understarding the data
I performed exploratory data analysis at this point. And I began by comprehending the data head, data tail, shape, size, columns, uniqueness of the data, type of included variable, and data kinds, not to mention the data types.

## Cleaning the data
At this point, I must eliminate any unnecessary variables and values from the data set as well as any irregularities because they can have a negative impact on our findings. To check the missing or null values, I used the data.isnull().sum() code.

## Findings
- Fortunately, none of my data had null values.
- Most people don't have children
- The average body mass is 30
- Age - The oldest person is 64 yrs and the lowest 18 yrs
